the pluggable python framework for IRC bots and Twitch bots

## Tutorial
### Installation
```
$ pip install pinhook
```

### Creating an IRC Bot
To create the bot, just create a python file with the following:

```python
from pinhook.bot import Bot

bot = Bot(
    channels=['#foo', '#bar'],
    nickname='ph-bot',
    server='irc.freenode.net'
)
bot.start()
```

This will start a basic bot and look for plugins in the 'plugins' directory to add functionality.

Optional arguments are:
* `port`: choose a custom port to connect to the server (default: 6667)
* `ops`: list of operators who can do things like make the bot join other channels or quit (default: empty list)
* `plugin_dir`: directory where the bot should look for plugins (default: "plugins")
* `log_level`: string indicating logging level. Logging can be disabled by setting this to "off". (default: "info")
* `ns_pass`: this is the password to identify with nickserv
* `server_pass`: password for the server
* `ssl_required`: boolean to turn ssl on or off

### Creating a Twitch Bot
Pinhook has a baked in way to connect directly to a twitch channel

```python
from pinhook.bot import TwitchBot

bot = TwitchBot(
    nickname='ph-bot',
    channel='#channel',
    token='super-secret-oauth-token'
)
bot.start()
```
This function has far less options, as the server, port, and ssl are already handled by twitch.

Optional aguments are:
* `ops`
* `plugin_dir`
* `log_level`

These options are the same for both IRC and Twitch

### Creating plugins
There are two types of plugins, commands and listeners. Commands only activate if a message starts with the command word, while listeners receive all messages and are parsed by the plugin for maximum flexibility.

In your chosen plugins directory ("plugins" by default) make a python file with a function. You use the `@pinhook.plugin.register` decorator to create command plugins, or `@pinhook.plugin.listener` to create listeners.

The function will need to be structured as such:
```python
import pinhook.plugin

@pinhook.plugin.register('!test')
def test_plugin(msg):
    message = '{}: this is a test!'.format(msg.nick)
    return pinhook.plugin.message(message)
```

The function will need to accept a single argument in order to accept a `Message` object from the bot.

The `Message` object has the following attributes:
* `cmd`: (for command plugins) the command that triggered the function
* `nick`: the user who triggered the command
* `arg`: (for command plugins) all the trailing text after the command. This is what you will use to get optional information for the command
* `text`: (for listener plugins) the entire text of the message
* `channel`: the channel where the command was initiated
* `ops`: the list of bot operators
* `botnick`: the nickname of the bot
* `logger`: instance of `Bot`'s logger
* `datetime`: aware `datetime.datetime` object when the `Message` object was created
* `timestamp`: float for the unix timestamp when the `Message` object was created

It also contains the following IRC functions:
* `privmsg`: send a message to an arbitrary channel or user
* `action`: same as privmsg, but does a CTCP action. (i.e., `/me does a thing`)
* `notice`: send a notice

**OR**

The plugin function can return one of the following in order to give a response to the command:
* `pinhook.plugin.message`: basic message in channel where command was triggered
* `pinhook.plugin.action`: CTCP action in the channel where command was triggered (basically like using `/me does a thing`)

## Examples
There are some basic examples in the `examples` directory in this repository.

Here is a list of live bots using pinhook:
* [pinhook-tilde](https://github.com/archangelic/pinhook-tilde) - fun bot for tilde.town
* [adminbot](https://github.com/tildetown/adminbot) - admin helper bot for tilde.town, featuring some of the ways you can change the Bot class to suit your needs
